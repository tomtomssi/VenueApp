# VenueApp [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomtomssi/VenueApp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/tomtomssi/VenueApp)

Simple Angular app that searches for venues close to the user and displays them on a map

To run, create a configuration file with your Foursquare ids:

`app/config/configuration.js`

`gConfiguration = {`
    `client_id: "your_id",`
    `client_secret: "your_secret"`
`};`
